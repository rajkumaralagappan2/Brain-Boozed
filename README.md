# Brain-Boozed- A Simon game Project for Beginners

Welcome to the repository Brain-Boozed for the Simon's Game projectâ€”a fun and interactive game built for beginners using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whether you're new to programming or looking to strengthen your front-end skills, this project is a great way to dive into the world of web development.

## Project Overview

Simon's Game is a classic memory and pattern recognition game. Players must follow a sequence of colors presented by the game and replicate it accurately. The game gets progressively challenging as the sequence lengthens, testing and improving the player's memory skills.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structuring the game layout.
- **CSS:** Styling the game elements for an engaging user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Implementing game logic, user interactions, and dynamic behavior.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajkumaralagappan2/Brain-Boozed.git
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in Your Browser:**
   Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to start playing the game.

3. **Follow the Sequence:**
   Watch as the game generates a sequence of colored buttons. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the buttons in the correct order.

4. **Level Up:**
   Successfully replicating the sequence advances you to the next level, where the challenge intensifies with longer sequences.

5. **Game Over:**
   The game ends when you make a mistake in replicating the sequence. Your high score is recorded, so aim to beat your best performance!
